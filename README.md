# PassGen

This is a simple Python script for generating secure, random passwords. It combines letters, numbers, and special characters to ensure strong password creation.

### Features

- Generates passwords with customizable lengths.

- Includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

- Simple and intuitive console-based interface.

### Requirements

Before running this program, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

No additional libraries are required, as the script uses Python's built-in modules (string and random).

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository or copy the script to your local environment.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the script with the following command:

		python password_generator.py

4. Enter the desired length of the password when prompted:

		 Enter the password length: 12

5. The script will generate and display a random password:

		The generated password is: x8@Fz3P!q2Rs

### Example Output
For a password length of 16, the output might look like:

	Enter the password length: 16
	The generated password is: T8&jK!z@1xL$3pQ*

#### Notes

- Ensure the password length is sufficient to meet security standards. A minimum of 12 characters is recommended for strong passwords.

- Special characters are included to enhance security, but you can modify the caracteres variable in the script if specific requirements are needed.
